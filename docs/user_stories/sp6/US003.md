# 1. Requirements

> **"As a System Manager I want that the list of standard categories to include those loaded (whenever needed) from a complementary system defined by configuration."**

## 1.1 Description

The system manager has the possibility of obtaining the list of standard categories that include categories from the system and categories from an external system.

**Demo1** As a System Manager I want the list of standard categories to include those loaded from a complementary system.

- Demo1.1. There can be categories with the same designation.
- Demo1.2. If for some reason the categories loaded from a complementary system aren't shown to the system manager, the standard categories of the system have to be in the list anyway.

For this user storie, is necessary to make the standard our standard categories accessible to the other groups. And for us to obtain the standard categories of group 1 or 3, through the implementation of a configuration file.
# 2. Analysis

## 2.2 Product Owner

- Some answers of the product owner (PO) are important in some design decisions.
> "Caso não consiga aceder às categorias standard do sistema externo -servidor está offline por exemplo-devemos lançar uma exepção ou retornamos apenas as categorias standard do nosso sistema."

> (PO) --> "Se não consegue aceder ao serviço configurado inclui apenas as locais"

## 2.3 US Dependencies

This user story is dependent of [US001](docs/user_stories/sp1/US001.md), since it's necessary to create local standard categories in order to have categories in the categories list.  
However, it doesn't have other user stories depending on it.

participant ":GetAllStandardCategoriesController" as controller
participant ":CategoryService" as service

participant ":CategoryRepository" as rep
participant "standardCategories:\nList<Category>" as listCat

[o-> controller : GetRequest \n/categories/standard/list
activate controller

controller -> service :getListOfAllStandardCategories()
activate service

service ->rep :getStandardCategories()
activate rep
rep -> listCat **:create
rep --> service :standardCategories
deactivate rep
service -> outdto :addAll()
activate outdto
group ref : getListOfExternalStandardCategories
           service -> service :getListOfExternalStandardCategories()
           service -> outdto :addAll()
        end
deactivate outdto
service --> controller :categoriesList
deactivate service
[<--o controller :categoriesList
deactivate controller
deactivate outdto
```
In this general sequence diagram, is possible to analyse with better detail the interaction between the classes that
are involved in the user story. In this case, it's starts with a Get request to the rest controller, in order to get the list
of all the standard categories (local and external). 

In the category service, it's created a new list of Out DTO's, that are the ones that take the information from the service to the controller and to the system manager. 
We start by getting all the local standard categories, that are the ones in our database. In step 5, it's categories that are in the database, 
are transformed in domain objects and added to a list of Categories, which is returned to the service, and added to the list of Out DTO's.
Then is necessary to get all the external categories, and add them also to the list of Out DTOs. 
And is this list that returns the information to the system manager.

```plantuml
title **US003: getListOfExternalStandardCategories()**
skinparam titleFontSize 20
autonumber
skinparam responseMessageBelowArrow true
skinparam sequenceMessageAlign left
skinparam monochrome true

participant ":CategoryService" as service
participant ":OutStandard\nCategoryDTOMapper" as mapperSt
participant "categoriesList:\nList<OutStandardCategoryDTO>" as dtoList
participant ":CategoryHttpRepository" as httprep
participant ":ExternalAPI" as api
participant ":ExternalCategoryMapper" as mapper
participant "standardList:\nList<StandardCategoryDTO>" as dto

service -> httprep :getStandardCategories()
activate httprep
activate service
activate api
httprep -> api :GetRequest /externalAPIURL
||20||
api --> httprep :response:ExternalStandard\nCategoryDTOWrapper
||20||
deactivate api
httprep -> mapper :toStandardDTOList(response.getDTOList())
activate mapper
mapper -> dto **:create
loop for each ExternalStandardCategoryDTO in externalDTOList
||20||
mapper -> mapper :standardCategoryDTO=toStandardDTO\n(ExternalStandardCategoryDTO)
activate dto
mapper -> dto :add(StandardCategoryDTO)
deactivate dto
end
mapper --> httprep :standardList
deactivate mapper
httprep--> service :standardList
deactivate httprep
service ->mapperSt :toOutStandardCategory\nDTOList(standardList)
activate mapperSt
mapperSt -> dtoList **:create
||20||
mapperSt --> service :categoriesList
deactivate mapperSt
||20||
[<--o service :categoriesList
deactivate service
```
This diagram allows us to have a better understanding of the necessary process in order to get the standard categories from an 
external service. 
Starting in the category service, the method of the Category Http Repository  is called, and it's in this repository, that a Get request is
made to the external service, the response that we expect to receive is a DTO Wrapper that will have a list with DTO's that correspond to the standard categories.
In order to retrieve the information from the Wrapper, we use a Mapper, that iterates over the list of categories inside the wrapper, and transforms each category DTO in a Standard Category DTO.
It's a list of standard category DTO's that is returned to the category service, where is going 
to be transformed into OUT DTOs. 

_Configuration File_

Another important step of the implementation of this user storie is the configuration file, that will allow 
the connection between our system and a chosen external system. 
This configuration is made through the use of the 'bean' annotation. 

```
 <!--<bean id="groupRepo"
          class="switchtwentytwenty.project.interfaceadaptor.repository.http.repository.GroupThreeExternalCategoryRepository"/>-->

    <bean id="groupRepo"
          class="switchtwentytwenty.project.interfaceadaptor.repository.http.repository.GroupOneExternalCategoryRepository"/>

```
We have two beans,that correspond to the two http repositories from each group.
In this case the group three repository is commented so when initializing the application and if we make the 
Get request to the rest controller, we will obtain the group one external standard categories. 

This file is injected through the Application Context Provider that is Autowired in the category service, since it's in this 
layer that the repository is being used.
