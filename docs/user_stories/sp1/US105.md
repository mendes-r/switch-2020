## 1. Requirements

>__"As a family administrator, I want to create a relation between two family members."__

## 1.1 Description

The family administrator has the possibility to select two members of his family and define a relation between them.
The selected members cannot be the same person and don't need to include the administrator. That give us a more flexible functionality by maintaining the possibility of a broader range of connections if necessary.

**Demo1** As family administrator, I want to select two members that I want to relate

- Demo1.1. if a family as less than two members, I cannot go further with this function.
- Demo1.2. a list of family members is displayed to me, and I select two members.
- Demo2.1. I choose the type of relation that connects the two family members.

We interpreted this requirement as a direct possibility of the family administrator to connect any member of the family to another member through a family relation.

## 2. Analysis

## 2.1 Domain Model according to Evans

package "Person Aggregate"{
  class Person <<Entity>> <<Root>> {}
}

package "Family Aggregate"{
  class Family <<Entity>> <<Root>> {}
}

class Email <<Value Object>> <<ID>> {}
class FamilyID <<Value Object>> <<ID>> {}

class FamilyRelation <<Value Object>> {}
class RelationType <<Value Object>> {}



'----------Associations----------

Person "1" -r> "1" Email : "id          "

Family "1" --> "1" FamilyID : id

Person "1" -l-> "1" FamilyID : inFamily

Family "1" -r-> "0..*" FamilyRelation

FamilyRelation "1" --> "1" RelationType
FamilyRelation "0..1" --> "1" Email : personID
FamilyRelation "0..1" --> "1" Email : kinID

## 2.2 Product Owner 

Some answers from the product owner (PO) are important in some design decisions.

> The definition of a relation isn't done at the creation of a member of the family. 
>
- That means that at anytime the family administrator has the power to define it.

> Q: As a family administrator, I want to get a list of family members, and the relation that they have with me. 
> 
> A: It's possible, but it would mean to translate existing relations to relations with the family administrator.
>
> Q: As family administrator, I want to get a list of family members and all possible relations between them. 
> 
> A: There are a lot of possible combinations. That functionality seems useless.

- The greatest question here hangs on the possibility of just being necessary to relate a member and his family administrator.
If we interpret the last answer as to display all relations as something useless. It would mean that the US105 wants to let the administrator create a relation between any two members. This interpretation is supported by the second answer.

## 2.3 Decisions

- The family relations are stored in a list inside the Family class. The family knows the relations of its members.

- The FamilyRelation instance has three instance variables: a person ID, a kin ID and a relation type that connects the two members. 
  
- To avoid the creation of a symmetric family relation, i.e. person is parent of kin and kin is child of person, the RelationType value object will have a method to return its opposite value. The class is immutable.
That forces us to a special override of the equals() method: two instances of FamilyRelation are the same if personID == other.personID && kinID == other.kinID || personID == other.kinID && kinID == other.personID. One interesting drawback was identified during the implementation of a persistence layer.
  The translation between Object-oriented programming and a relational database is not perfect if the above mentioned definition of the equals method is adopted. To overturn this problem a special validation must be made before "saving" the instance in the database.
  
- When creating and adding a new FamilyRelation, we need first see if this family relation was already defined, using the above mentioned equals() method.
If true, we delete this FamilyRelation instance and create a new one. If it returns false, we just create a new instance.
The function can act has creator or updater.
  
## 2.4 Dependent US

- The [US104](US104.md) is greatly dependent on the present US.
- The way [US104](US104.md) accesses the information is closely related to the way this US is implemented.
- The [US106](../sp2/US106.md) user story talks about updating an existent family relation. This functionality is already covered by this US.

# 4. Implementation


# 5. Integration/Demo


# 6. Observations

The mapping from OO to relational database could be handled differently. 
The solution adopted to answer the symmetry between family relations could be different by accepting that the redundant information is not important since the PO didn't define here any special requirements.
